# Claude-Step7.md - VS Code Extension Integration

## Current State
ACAS Runner operates as a standalone web application. To provide seamless developer experience, we need to create a VS Code extension that integrates directly with the developer's IDE, providing real-time monitoring, AI assistance, and workflow automation within the editor.

## Implementation Goals

### 1. VS Code Extension Development
**Location**: `vscode-extension/`

Create a comprehensive VS Code extension that:
- **Real-time Activity Monitoring** - Track file changes, errors, and coding activity
- **AI Assistant Integration** - Direct access to LLM providers within VS Code
- **Plugin System Bridge** - Execute ACAS Runner plugins from VS Code
- **Workflow Automation** - Trigger workflows from within the editor

### 2. Bi-directional Communication
**Location**: `vscode-extension/src/communication/`

Implement seamless data flow:
- **Extension to ACAS** - Send activity data, trigger escalations
- **ACAS to Extension** - Receive AI suggestions, workflow results
- **Real-time Sync** - Keep extension and web app in sync
- **Offline Support** - Queue actions when ACAS Runner is offline

### 3. Embedded AI Assistant
**Location**: `vscode-extension/src/ai/`

Build in-editor AI features:
- **Inline Code Suggestions** - AI-powered code completion and fixes
- **Error Analysis** - Automatic error detection and resolution suggestions
- **Code Review** - AI code review comments and suggestions
- **Documentation Generation** - Auto-generate docs and comments

### 4. Workflow Integration
**Location**: `vscode-extension/src/workflows/`

Connect workflows to development environment:
- **Context-aware Triggers** - Workflows triggered by editor events
- **Workflow Execution Status** - Real-time workflow progress in VS Code
- **Quick Actions** - Execute common workflows via command palette
- **Custom Commands** - User-defined workflow shortcuts

## Implementation Priority

1. **Critical**: Basic extension setup and ACAS connection
2. **Critical**: Activity monitoring and data sync
3. **High**: AI assistant integration and code actions
4. **High**: Workflow execution from VS Code
5. **Medium**: Advanced UI components and tree views
6. **Medium**: Configuration and customization options
7. **Low**: Advanced features (collaborative editing, etc.)
8. **Low**: Extension marketplace and distribution

## Success Criteria

- Extension connects reliably to ACAS Runner
- Real-time activity monitoring works without performance impact
- AI suggestions appear contextually in VS Code
- Workflows can be triggered and monitored from editor
- Extension provides seamless developer experience
- Configuration is intuitive and flexible

## Integration Points

- **Activity Monitor** (Step 1): Real-time activity sync between VS Code and web app
- **AI Escalation** (Step 2): Direct AI assistance within editor context
- **Plugin System** (Step 3): Execute plugins from VS Code commands
- **Chat System** (Step 4): Quick AI chat access from command palette
- **Workflow Orchestration** (Step 5): Trigger and monitor workflows in editor
- **Analytics** (Step 6): Contribute editor-specific metrics
- **Team Collaboration** (Step 7): Share VS Code activity with team

## Files to Create/Modify

### VS Code Extension
- `vscode-extension/` (new directory)
  - `src/extension.ts`
  - `src/communication/acas-connection.ts`
  - `src/monitoring/activity-monitor.ts`
  - `src/ai/ai-assistant.ts`
  - `src/workflows/workflow-manager.ts`
  - `src/providers/`
  - `src/ui/`
  - `package.json`
  - `tsconfig.json`

### ACAS Runner Backend
- `src/api/extension/` (new directory)
- WebSocket handlers for extension communication
- Extension-specific service layer

## Next Step
After implementing the VS Code extension, proceed to **Claude-Step8.md** for Team Collaboration features.
