# Claude-Step8.md - Team Collaboration Features

## Current State
ACAS Runner is currently designed as a single-user developer tool. To support team environments, we need to implement collaboration features, shared workspaces, team analytics, and real-time synchronization.

## Implementation Goals

### 1. Team Workspace Management
**Location**: `src/app/(app)/teams/page.tsx`

Create team collaboration infrastructure:
- **Team Creation and Management** - Create, invite, manage team members
- **Shared Project Workspaces** - Common project monitoring across team
- **Role-based Access Control** - Admin, developer, viewer roles
- **Team Settings and Preferences** - Shared configurations and standards

### 2. Real-time Collaboration
**Location**: `src/services/collaboration/`

Implement live collaboration features:
- **Shared Activity Streams** - Team members see each other's activity
- **Live Chat Rooms** - Team-specific chat channels
- **Collaborative Debugging** - Shared escalation sessions
- **Live Workflow Collaboration** - Multiple users building workflows

### 3. Knowledge Sharing System
**Location**: `src/app/(app)/knowledge/page.tsx`

Build team knowledge base:
- **Shared Documentation** - Team-editable docs and guides
- **Code Pattern Library** - Reusable code snippets and patterns
- **Escalation History** - Searchable team escalation database
- **Best Practices Repository** - Team coding standards and practices

### 4. Team Analytics and Insights
**Location**: `src/services/analytics/team-analytics.ts`

Extend analytics for team context:
- **Team Performance Dashboards** - Aggregate team metrics
- **Member Comparison Views** - Individual vs team performance
- **Collaboration Effectiveness** - How well team works together
- **Knowledge Sharing Metrics** - Documentation usage and contribution

## Technical Requirements

### Team Data Models
```typescript
// src/types/team.ts
export interface Team {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  avatar?: string;
  created: Date;
  updated: Date;
  settings: TeamSettings;
  subscription?: TeamSubscription;
}

export interface TeamMember {
  userId: string;
  teamId: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'developer' | 'viewer';
  joinedAt: Date;
  permissions: TeamPermission[];
  status: 'active' | 'invited' | 'suspended';
  lastActive?: Date;
}

export interface TeamSettings {
  defaultAIProvider: string;
  sharedEscalationRules: EscalationRule[];
  codeStandards: CodeStandard[];
  workflowTemplates: WorkflowTemplate[];
  notificationPreferences: NotificationSettings;
  privacySettings: {
    shareActivityByDefault: boolean;
    allowCrossTeamSharing: boolean;
    dataRetentionDays: number;
  };
}
```

### Real-time Collaboration
```typescript
// src/services/collaboration/real-time-service.ts
export class RealTimeCollaborationService {
  async joinTeamWorkspace(teamId: string, workspaceId: string): Promise<void>;
  async leaveTeamWorkspace(teamId: string, workspaceId: string): Promise<void>;
  
  // Activity sharing
  async broadcastActivity(teamId: string, activity: ActivityEvent): Promise<void>;
  async subscribeToTeamActivity(teamId: string, callback: (activity: ActivityEvent) => void): void;
  
  // Live chat
  async sendTeamMessage(teamId: string, channelId: string, message: string): Promise<void>;
  async subscribeToTeamChat(teamId: string, channelId: string, callback: (message: ChatMessage) => void): void;
  
  // Collaborative sessions
  async createCollaborativeSession(teamId: string, type: 'debugging' | 'workflow' | 'planning'): Promise<string>;
  async joinCollaborativeSession(sessionId: string): Promise<void>;
  async shareScreen(sessionId: string, screenData: ScreenShare): Promise<void>;
}
```

## Implementation Priority

1. **Critical**: Basic team creation and member management
2. **Critical**: Team workspace and shared activity streams
3. **High**: Real-time chat and presence
4. **High**: Knowledge base with documents and patterns
5. **Medium**: Collaborative editing features
6. **Medium**: Team analytics and insights
7. **Low**: Advanced collaboration features (screen sharing, etc.)
8. **Low**: Enterprise features (SSO, advanced permissions)

## Success Criteria

- Teams can be created and managed effectively
- Real-time collaboration works smoothly across team members
- Knowledge sharing increases team productivity
- Team analytics provide actionable insights
- Collaboration features have minimal latency (<500ms)
- Knowledge base is searchable and well-organized
- Team member onboarding is streamlined

## Integration Points

- **Activity Monitor** (Step 1): Share activities across team members
- **AI Escalation** (Step 2): Team escalation rules and shared solutions
- **Plugin System** (Step 3): Team-wide plugin sharing and templates
- **Chat System** (Step 4): Team chat channels and collaboration
- **Workflow Orchestration** (Step 5): Shared workflow templates
- **Analytics** (Step 6): Team performance and collaboration metrics

## Files to Create/Modify

- `src/app/(app)/teams/page.tsx` (new)
- `src/services/collaboration/` (new directory)
- `src/services/knowledge/` (new directory)
- `src/components/teams/` (new directory)
- `src/types/team.ts` (new)
- `src/api/teams/` (new API routes)
- Database migration for team tables
- WebSocket handlers for real-time features

## Next Step
After implementing team collaboration features, proceed to **Claude-Step9.md** for Mobile/Progressive Web App development.
